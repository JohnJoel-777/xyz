   <b>Story 2 :The Brave Ant</b><br>
   <p>Bheeman , the python was very happy.<br>
He had come to live in a new forest , <br>
and had found a big hole in a banyan <br>
tree to live in. The banyan tree was near <br>
a pond. <br><br>
Many small animals lived in this place , <br>
frogs , fishes , birds and lizards. Bheeman ate <br>
them every day , and grew fat. <br><br>
' I am the king of this jungle ,' thought <br>
Bheeman proudly. ' Everybody should bow  <br>
before me. ' Whenever he crawled <br>
around , all the small creatures hid <br>
themselves. Bheeman felt immensely strong and <br>
powerful. <br><br>
One day , Bheeman thought of <br>
changing his home. He selected a bigger tree , <br>
which he felt was a more suitable <br>
home for a king. Under this tree <br>
Meenu , the queen ant , lived with her <br>
fellow ants. <br><br>
Bheeman asked the ants to vacate the <br>
premises at once. <br>
Meenu refused to leave , since the tree <br>
had been the ants' home for many <br>
years. Bheeman was very angry. <br>
He wanted to teach the ants a lesson. <br><br>
He attacked them with his tail <br>
Meenu immediately asked her army
of ants to march ahead. <br>
The ants bit every inch of Bheeman's body <br>
Bheeman started howling in pain. <br>
He accepted defeat and begged the ants <br>
for forgiveness. <br><br>
Bheeman had understood that even tiny <br>
creatures had their own strengths , <br>
and had to be respected. </p><br>
